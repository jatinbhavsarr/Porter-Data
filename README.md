# **Porter: Logistics and Dasher Performance Analytics Dashboard**

## **Executive Summary**  
The Porter project involves creating an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize logistics data, focusing on Dashers (delivery personnel) performance. The dashboard integrates data from delivery operations, Dashers' work history, and customer feedback to provide actionable insights that help optimize delivery efficiency, improve logistics management, and enhance overall service quality.

## **Business Problem**  
Porter faced difficulties in optimizing delivery routes, managing Dasher performance, and ensuring timely deliveries. The lack of a unified platform to track Dasher performance and delivery efficiency led to operational inefficiencies, missed delivery windows, and poor customer satisfaction. The business needed a way to analyze Dashers' activities and enhance logistics operations to improve customer service and reduce delivery costs.

## **Objective**  
The primary objective of this project was to build a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that:
- Tracks Dasher performance, including delivery time, accuracy, market ID, and ratings.
- Identifies high-performing Dashers for recognition and retention strategies.
- Enhances decision-making by providing actionable insights into logistics operations.

## **Tools I Use**  
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive visualizations and performance dashboards.  
- **Power Query**: For data transformation, cleaning, and integration from various logistics data sources.  
- **DAX**: For advanced data analysis, calculations, and performance metrics.  
- **SQL Server**: For querying and extracting logistics and Dasher data from internal databases.

## **Suggestions**  
- The total revenue for January and February 2015 reached ₹474 million. January generated ₹167 million, while February saw a significant increase to ₹307 million.
- During this period, the total number of orders increased from 61,840 in January to 113,940 in February, indicating a strong upward trend in customer demand.
- The average order value remained consistent at ₹975, reflecting stable purchasing behavior among customers.
- Among the product offerings, OP-1 and OP-3 stood out with the highest average order values, indicating their popularity and potential for further promotion.
- Store-4 and Store-55 achieved the highest total revenue, each generating ₹96 million, showcasing their effectiveness in driving sales.

## **Challenges**  
A key challenge was managing and integrating data from different sources, including Dasher performance, delivery times, and customer feedback. Ensuring data accuracy and consistency was critical for providing reliable insights. Additionally, designing dynamic Power BI reports that reflect real-time data from ongoing deliveries while maintaining optimal dashboard performance required efficient data modeling and query optimization.

## **Learnings**  
- Gained expertise in using DAX to calculate KPIs for Dasher performance and delivery efficiency.
- Enhanced skills in Power Query for cleaning and transforming logistics data from various sources.
- Learned to create interactive and user-friendly dashboards that allow logistics managers to make data-driven decisions quickly.
- Gained insights into optimizing delivery operations and logistics workflows to reduce costs and improve customer satisfaction.
- Developed expertise in optimizing Power BI dashboards for performance, especially when dealing with large datasets and real-time data.
